# Limerick
Finding if a poem is a limerick

A limerick is defined as a poem with the form AABBA, where the A lines rhyme with each other, the B lines rhyme with each other, and the A lines do not rhyme with the B lines. There are also constraints on how many syllables can be in a line; these are provided in the code templates.

The goal is to create a piece of code that will determine whether a poem is a limerick or not. To do this, we will be using the <strong> CMU pronunciation dictionary</strong>.

Language used: Python 2.7

Run tests.py to see results.
